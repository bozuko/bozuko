Last Revised June 28, 2011

### OUR COMMITMENT TO PRIVACY

This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) sets forth the information privacy practices of Bozuko, Inc. (“Bozuko”, “we” or “us”)
for www.bozuko.com (the “Site”). Except where otherwise expressly indicated in this Privacy Policy or on the Site, this
Privacy Policy applies only to information collected on the Site and does not apply to information collected outside of the
Site. This Privacy Policy also does not apply to content, business information, ideas, concepts or inventions that you send
to Bozuko by email. Please refer to our <Terms of Use> for our policy with respect to such information. If you want to
keep such information private or proprietary, please do not send it in an email or otherwise provide such information to
Bozuko. Before using or submitting information to the Site, please review this Privacy Policy carefully.

Certain areas of the Site contain information, software or services (collectively, “Services”) intended only for users who
register for it (“Registered Users”) and we reserve the right to limit access to Services to Registered Users. This Privacy
Policy addresses our privacy practices relating to general use of the Site, as well as use of the Site by Registered Users.

### INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT

1. Information Bozuko Collects.
  
    Bozuko collects the following types of information from users of the Site:

    1. Personal Information: Personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) is information that can be
    used to identify or contact you, such as your name, email address, mailing address, telephone number or similar
    information. The Personally Information that you provide will be used by Bozuko only in accordance with this
    Privacy Policy. Examples of Personal Information that we may collect from you are:

        * your name, e-mail address, mailing address and other information you choose to provide us if
          you are a Registered User or otherwise asked to provide such information, such as Facebook account
          information that you provide in connection with your use of Bozuko’s Services;
        
        * information provided by winners of sweepstakes offered through the Services; and
        
        * names and e-mail addresses of those who communicate with Bozuko by e-mail.

        You may choose not to provide us with certain Personal Information but then you may not be able to take
        advantage of certain features of the Site.

    2.  Aggregate Information: When you visit the Site, we may monitor your activity on the Site. We may collect
    various categories of non-personally identifiable information, including, without limitation, browser information,
    operating system information, IP address and aggregated statistics generated from visitors to our Site. This
    information will not be stored in a manner that is personally identifiable with you.

        We use “cookies” to help you access and navigate the Site more efficiently and to statistically monitor how many
    users are accessing the Site. A “cookie” is a small file or tool stored on a user’s hard drive containing information
    that allows us to deliver customized information to you. You may set your browser to notify you of or decline
    the receipt of cookies but certain features of the Site may not function properly or be available if your browser is
    configured to disable cookies.
        
        We use both “session” and “persistent” cookies on this Site. Session cookies are temporary bits of information
    that are erased once you exit your web browser or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies are more
    permanent bits of information that are placed on the hard drive of your computer and stay there unless you
    delete the cookie. They store information on your computer for a number of reasons, such as helping to
    determine what areas of the Site you find most valuable. Persistent cookies placed on your computer by this Site
    do not store any personal information.

2. How Bozuko Uses Information

    When you provide Bozuko with your Personal Information, Bozuko may use it to provide the Services to you, facilitate
communication between Bozuko and you and/or provide you with other information Bozuko feels may be of interest
to you. Bozuko also uses information collected to customize, analyze, adjust and improve the Site to meet users’ needs.
Bozuko also may use the information to enforce Bozuko’s agreements with you, to prevent fraud and other prohibited or
illegal activities and for other legally permissible purposes. These uses of your Personal Information may include, without
limitation, the following:

    1. Registered User Areas: Certain areas of the Site are accessible only to Registered Users (“Registered User
    Areas”). Bozuko may use the Personal Information that you provide when registering to become a Registered
    User and using Registered User Areas to: fulfill your specific requests; administer your account; send you
    information about enhancements, offers and features of the Registered User Areas and other information that
    Bozuko believes is relevant and useful to its Registered Users; and troubleshoot technical problems. Bozuko
    does not sell mailing lists (names and mailing addresses) or e-mail addresses of Registered Users to third parties.

    2. Aggregate Information: The aggregate information collected by Bozuko is used to create profiles of the
    audience for the Site that include anonymous statistical demographic information but no Personal Information.

    experience for its users.

    administrative information regarding the Site and related services or changes to our <Terms of Use>, this
