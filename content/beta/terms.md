successors and assigns. This Agreement and the licenses granted hereunder may be assigned by Bozuko but
may not be assigned by Licensee without the prior express written consent of Bozuko. If any provision hereof is
or becomes, at any time or for any reason, unenforceable or invalid, no other provision hereof will be affected
thereby and the remaining provisions will continue with the same effect as if such unenforceable or invalid
provisions will not have been inserted herein; provided that the ability of either party to obtain substantially
the bargained-for performance of the other will not have thereby been impaired. It is expressly understood
that in the event either party on any occasion fails to perform any term hereof and the other party does not
enforce that term, the failure to enforce on any occasion will not constitute a waiver of any term and will not
prevent enforcement on any other occasion. Nothing contained in this Agreement will be deemed to constitute
either party as the agent or representative of the other party or both parties as joint venturers or partners for
any purpose. In the event that either party is prevented from performing, or is unable to perform, any of its
obligations under this Agreement due to any cause beyond the reasonable control of the party invoking this
provision, the affected party's performance will be extended for the period of delay or inability to perform due to
such occurrence. The headings and captions contained herein will not be considered to be part of the Agreement
but are for convenience only. This Agreement will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance
with the internal laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without giving effect to the principles of conflicts
of laws of such state, and will be binding upon the parties hereto in the United States and worldwide. Licensee
and Bozuko agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not
apply to the interpretation or construction of this Agreement. Any claims or legal actions by one party against
the other arising under this Agreement or concerning any rights under this Agreement will be commenced and
maintained in any state or federal court located in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and both parties hereby
submit to the jurisdiction and venue of any such court. This Agreement, together with the [Terms of Use] and
